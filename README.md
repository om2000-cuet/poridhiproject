Here I have tried to implement  a front end using React JS,  backend using Node Js, Mongo DB as Database Server and Redis as cache server.
Basicaly it is a simple implementation where I am saving data to MongoDB server, and while fetching data, I have checked if data is already present in Redis Cache or not. If data is not present in Redis cache, i am fetching data from MongoDab and saving it to Redis cache to improve performance.

To Run  the project in your system

1) Need Node JS installed
2) MongoDB installed
3) Redis Server installed
